# README Creator
## Description
So you've got all your code set up for your application. All you need to do now is write a high-quality README! Except... you're not *quite* sure how to make one by hand yet. Not to worry, though. That's where the README generator comes in! Simply run this little app using your operating system's terminal, answer some questions about the project you're making, and a README file will be generated for you!
### Why did I make this?
Many times, when people are just starting out on their web development career, on top of making HTML/CSS/JavaScript/etc. code that functions exactly the way it needs to function, they will need to make a professional README file that informs others of how their applications work. The first few times they finish thier projects, it can be hard to make a README that's properly structured, in addition to trying to figure out what kind of information you should put in their README. But it doesn't have to be this way.
### What problem does this solve?
For those who are trying to come up with a well-structured README for their projects, they could use this to generate one automatically with all the needed markup.
### What did I learn?
I loved learning about how node.js works. It's so much fun typing "node [insert JS file here]" in the terminal and watching code you made being logged. It's also very helpful because you don't have to rely on a browser's built-in console to test your JavaScript functions.

## Installation
First, you will need to install node.js by visiting the node.js [download page](https://nodejs.org/en/download). Then, you should download the node_modules folder from the GitHub repo so the app will have all the necessary dependencies needed to run the app. After that, all you need to do is open your computer's terminal and type in "node index.js" to run the app!
## Usage
This automatic README generator was made with new programmers in mind, but more experienced programmers are welcome to use this to make a README for their projects, too!
